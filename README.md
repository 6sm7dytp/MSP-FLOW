 # Supported OS
 
    There's a need to run Power applications on older devices, for those that have a slower hardware upgrade cycle.
    Minimum operating systems for PowerApps are Android 5, IOS 8 and Windows 8. 
    There will be workaround to run Powerapps on different operating systems, 
    but the percentage of not supported OS users is too low, to dive into this problem (now).
