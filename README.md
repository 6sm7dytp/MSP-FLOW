 # Supported OS
 
There's a need to run Power applications on older devices, for those that have a slower hardware upgrade cycle.
Minimum operating systems for PowerApps are **Android 5**, **IOS 8** and **Windows 8**. There will be workaround to run Powerapps on different operating systems, but the percentage of not supported OS users is too low, to dive into this problem (now).
