# Source code

In this folder you'll find the source code of the applications first version. However source code is availble within the Power Platform studio, you can only reset a certain version from 6 months ago. That's why the source code of the first version can be found here. 


## How to read
The base structure of the application will be the same as the first version. Each file will be named after the object the source is about. 


## What can I do with this?
You may or may not made changes within your application, that caused any harm to the functionality of your product. By saving the previous source code you can always compare or go back to the code (or settings) you had before the excident.
